### Playwright Mini

It is simple replacement of puppeteer extra but for playwright.

### Why?

Because google killed puppetter. Its not maintained properly. Lots of old bugs related to cookies are not fixed. And I dont see any future with puppetter.

### Why renamed Playwright Extra to Playwright Mini?

Actually I didn't realized the original developer have been developing another version of playwright extra. So I think they deserve the original name. I will be handing them the package name in future.

### Why Playwright?

Because the original developer from puppetter repo now maintains playwright. And they are cool :)

### Why not same structure as Puppetter Mini?

First I don't like that approach 12 gadget inside 12 folder and one package depending on another package. I am not necessarily saying that approach is bad as its clealy working for thm. I would like to keep it simple and flat.

### What is included in this pacakge?

I don't plan adding too much for simplicity. I just want to add only necessary stuff thats required for automation. Like I am not going to include adblocker extension etc.

### Disclaimer

I use it to automate my workflow. Like my bank gives 1 month data but to make summary of my expenditure I need 6 month data. Clearly I don't want to be in mercy of bank so the solution is to automate my workflow.
